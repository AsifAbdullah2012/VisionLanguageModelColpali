# VisionLanguageModelColpali

- The vidore/colpali-v1.2 model is an advanced visual document retriever developed by ILLUIN Vidore. It leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to efficiently index documents based on their visual features, generating multi-vector representations of text and images. This approach enables the model to compute interactions between text tokens and image patches, significantly enhancing performance in document retrieval tasks.

# Usage
- Works with Complex PDFs with logos, tables and graphs 
- Text based parsing from PDFs can not parse valuable information for example logos etc but colpali works for those
